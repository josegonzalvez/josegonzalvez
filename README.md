- 👋 Hi, I’m @josegonzalvez
- 👀 I’m a noob trying to learnd and improve myself. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things at same time, so maybe it's the reason I cannot finish anything. I would like to access to Finance data but...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on get info from API's and add to my SQL data base.
- 📫 How to reach me? I cannot guess why you would like to contact me but it's easy by insta: @jose_gonzalvez_oficial (mostly in Spanish) or email: jose.gonzalvez@me.com
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm not much into this, I'm too old.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Not being funny shall be ok
